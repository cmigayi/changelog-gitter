## Usage
1. Create a *change.js* file in your project root 

> sudo touch change.js

3. To use __changelog-gitter__ you should first initialize __Git__

> git init

4. You should know the following arguments: 

  * node change [log]
  
    Use this after posting atleast one change. It will generate the __CHANGELOG.md__ file in your project

    ii. [CHANGE_TYPE]
      They preceed documentation comments.

      * Depracted: Comment on any deprecated feature
      
      > sudo node change patch __deprecated__ "Feature x is no longer in use for v2.2.0"

    iii. ["COMMENT"]
    
      This are documentation comments. They should always be in double-qoutes.
